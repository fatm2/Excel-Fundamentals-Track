This repository contains my projects for [Excel Fundamentals track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/excel-fundamentals) . Throughout this track, you’ll learn how to prepare, visualize and analyze data through hands-on exercises. You’ll learn valuable skills such as preparing your data for further analysis through features such as PivotTables, V-Lookups, and Excel formulas before creating presentation-ready visualizations and dashboards.
You’ll then take advanced skills one step further by utilizing powerful features such as the What-if tool for sensitivity and scenario analysis before dipping into predictive analysis with the power of Excel’s forecasting features. By the end of this track, you’ll have gained the knowledge and skills to carry out analysis in Excel on real-world scenarios.


- ## Course  1: [Introduction to Excel](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-excel)


> In this Excel course, I learned the fundamentals needed to analyze data in spreadsheets. This course focused on helping me navigate Excel and prepare my data for basic analysis. I learned how to manage tables and apply calculations to my data to provide new insights.
I learned about the many available functions in Excel that helped me to perform calculations, analyze data, and, in some cases, automate tasks.
We finished this course by explaining the basics of using Excel to effectively communicate data through compelling visuals. I explored the versatility of area, column, and pie charts to help tell a story to bring my analysis to life.

- ## Course 2: [Data Preparation in Excel](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-preparation-in-excel)
> In this course, I learned how to prepare and clean raw data in Excel worksheets. I learned to bring in data from different sources and prepared the data by filtering, deduping, and organizing my columns and rows to ensure subsequent analysis tasks were done as efficiently as possible.
In addition to the built-in features Excel offers, I learned to use different functions to handle and manipulate dates and text strings. I was introduced to logical functions that allowed me to create new flags and categories within my raw data while understanding how different logical functions could be combined in nested formulas. I also learned how to use lookup functions in Excel to bring in data from different sheets and identify specific results within large datasets. Finally, I got my first glimpse of PivotTables - a powerful Excel feature that allows me to summarize and analyze large volumes of data using dynamic tables.

- ## Part 3: [Data Visualization in Excel](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-visualization-in-excel)


> In this course, Unlocking the power of data visualization with Excel was my ticket to becoming an independent data visualization wizard within a business analysis context. Whether I was a beginner or aiming to enhance my skills. I learned to tackle business challenges using a variety of visualizations, ranging from basic bar and line charts to more advanced scatter plots, bullet charts, and waterfalls. Visualizing insights on both summarized and disaggregated raw data (with PivotCharts) became second nature as I progressed through this course. Along the way, I mastered the best practices of data visualization and discovered how to harness visual design elements to maximize the impact of my data insights. Thanks to Excel, I brought life to visual insights!
