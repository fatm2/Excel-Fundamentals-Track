This repository contains my projects for [Excel Fundamentals track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/excel-fundamentals) . Throughout this track, you’ll learn how to prepare, visualize and analyze data through hands-on exercises. You’ll learn valuable skills such as preparing your data for further analysis through features such as PivotTables, V-Lookups, and Excel formulas before creating presentation-ready visualizations and dashboards.
You’ll then take advanced skills one step further by utilizing powerful features such as the What-if tool for sensitivity and scenario analysis before dipping into predictive analysis with the power of Excel’s forecasting features. By the end of this track, you’ll have gained the knowledge and skills to carry out analysis in Excel on real-world scenarios.
